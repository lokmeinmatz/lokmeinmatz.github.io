# Creation of this Blog

For a while I thought about creating my own blog.
I seached for different ways to archive this, preferabbly without having to pay on a monthly basis.
At this time, I tought my self developing in Vue.js, because I recognized that knowing Jquery and plain JavaScript isn't enough for developing a web-app (or is quickly getting unreadable and totally unstructured with all the Jquery-Callbacks).
Thus, I wanted to test my skills and write my own Blog-Page, rather than relying on Wordpress or similar ones.

My first thought was to use AWS [(Amazon Web Services)](https://aws.amazon.com "AWS main page"), but due to the need for an international creditcard (which I didn't own at this point) this was not an option.

I also looked at static side generators like [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo developer page"), which generate static HTML-Pages from Markdown, so I would only have to copy all files to a hosting-service. Cleaning up my github.io page, I decided to give it a try and use this service for blogging. After trying out HUGO for a few hours, I gave up, because it didn't provide the freedom I liked to have (or it looked quite difficult to set own themes etc. up).
